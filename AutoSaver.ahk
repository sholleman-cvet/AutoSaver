; This script auto saves your work for you.
; It counts how many seconds the target window is active/focused and will save your work 
; when that number reaches the seconds you set in the saveFrequency variable,
; however it will wait until you have stopped interacting with your mouse 
; and keyboard for the miliseconds you set in idleThreshold variable
; before sending ctrl + s to avoid interfering with your work.

targetWindowTitle = "" ; name of window to auto save. Hardcode it or use the hotkey below to set this to the current window
saveFrequency := 10 ; seconds between auto saves
idleThreshold := 300 ; miliseconds keyboard/mouse need to be idle for the script to send ctrl + s to save 
secondsSinceSave := 0 ; seconds since last save, don't change this value
